# Text Summarization Using Large Language Models

## Overview

Text summarization is a critical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with applications ranging from information retrieval to content generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown remarkable promise in enhancing summarization techniques. This repository will document the experiments conducted as part of the research under the KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program 2023, Cohort-3.

## Updated Experiment Files

In this project, I have recently updated the experiment files for the CNN Dailymail and XSum datasets, leveraging three different Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLMs include:

- **MPT-7b-instruct**
- **Falcon-7b-instruct**
- **Text-davinci-003**
